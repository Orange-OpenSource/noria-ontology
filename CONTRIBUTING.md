In particular, we seek the following types of contributions:

- **Testing & Validating**: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) like the one enabled by NORIA-O are highly relevant to federate information from heterogeneous sources and to get a comprehensive picture of complex network situations.
  Experience feedback with NORIA-O would be greatly appreciated in order to go beyond the initial development context.
- **Improving & Extending**: participate in making NORIA-O smoother and more linked, for example by adding definitions and matches to its controlled vocabulary, providing alignment with vocabularies from other application domains, adding model quality assessment automation, etc.

## Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed changes to this project.
Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

You may also contact the maintainers by e-mail for more specific purposes and questions.

In both contexts, please be kind and courteous. 
Language issues are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff. 
Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
