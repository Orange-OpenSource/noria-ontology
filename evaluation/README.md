# noria-ontology / evaluation

This folder contains the **NORIA evaluation documents**.

We provide a set of queries for the evaluation of the NORIA-O model in relation to some corresponding Knowledge Graph (KG) instance.

General approach:
* Design tests as SPARQL queries and store them in separate `.sparql` files.
* Run SPARQL queries on your SPARQL endpoint.
* Browse queries results.

Naming convention:
* `at_`: Authoring Tests (AT)
