# noria-ontology / dataset

This folder holds the datasets for the **NORIA fictitious case of supervision of a network infrastructure**.

This fictitious case serves both evaluation purposes, as seen with the authoring tests in the [../evaluation](../evaluation) folder, and as an example of the benefits of the NORIA-O proposal.
It demonstrates how NORIA-O can address network service issues, such as detecting k out-of n resilience problems, and cybersecurity issues by leveraging automated reasoning on data from multiple and heterogeneous sources.

Analyzing and solving such issues for large-scale networks requires the use of business rules, such as SPARQL queries, or AI-based techniques like graph embeddings.
This would be impossible without standardized interpretation of the data using controlled vocabularies and the integration of multiple sources.

The data and tools provided here highlight the knowledge graph construction step.

See sub-folders for each specific NORIA-O release.
