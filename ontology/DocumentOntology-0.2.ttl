Alignment:
- *DCMI*: from the DCMI Abstract Model perspective, a TroubleTicket is a described resource, hence DC terms apply:
  - troubleTicketId <=> http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier : Identifier of the trouble ticket.
  - troubleTicketCreationDateTime <=> http://purl.org/dc/terms/created : The Date on which the TroubleTicket was created in the ticketing system.
  - troubleTicketLastUpdate <=> http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified : The date and time that the TroubleTicket was last updated.
  - troubleTicketName <=> http://purl.org/dc/terms/title : Name of the TroubleTicket, typically a short description provided by the user that create the ticket or complementary data
  - troubleTicketDescription <=> http://purl.org/dc/terms/description : Extended description of the trouble or issue.

- *PEP*: a TroubleTicketNote is a context for (potentially) many *CorrectiveMaintenanceAction* to occur; hence it relates to a `pep:ProcedureExecutionContainer`, which in turns enable to track the corresponding `EventRecord` through the `ldp:member` property.
