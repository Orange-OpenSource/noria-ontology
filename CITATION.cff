abstract: >-
  The NORIA-O project is a data model for IT
  networks, events and operations information.

  The ontology is developed using web technologies
  (e.g. RDF, OWL, SKOS) and is intended as a
  structure for realizing an IT Service Management
  (ITSM) Knowledge Graph (KG) for Anomaly Detection
  (AD) and Risk Management applications.

  The model has been developed in collaboration with
  operational teams, and in connection with third
  parties linked vocabularies.
